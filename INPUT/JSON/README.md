# Input your JSON files here

The title of the JSON file becomes the title of the section and every JSON object needs to have a name attribute

## Example
```
[
    {
      "name": "Checkout my other stuff on github",
      "description": "It's worth it",
      "fname": "hsdjfhsdjhasjnfdjvnsdjfhsjdf",
      "input": "Thanks for checking out my website",
      "typeRef": "EasyArchiveType"
  }
]
```
